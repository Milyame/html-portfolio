<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Amir Fakarulisroq Bin Abdul Razak, a 30-year-old engineer from Malaysia with a solid academic background in mechatronics and manufacturing. I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering Technology (Hons) in Manufacturing from Universiti Malaysia Pahang Sultan Abdullah (UMPSA), and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Mechatronic Engineering at the same university..</p>

<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for object detection and AI, which started during my final year project (FYP). My FYP focused on fish classification and counting through machine vision, where I utilized advanced AI algorithms to detect and count different fish species. The data was then integrated with Ubidots for real-time monitoring, providing valuable insights for aquaculture management.</p>

<p>Driven by my interest in coding and technology, I am passionate about becoming a full stack developer. I have trained extensively in various programming languages and development frameworks through platforms like Udemy, AWS, and Coursera. I am committed to continuously expanding my skills and applying my practical knowledge to real-world problems.</p>

<p>I am eager to bring my passion for technology, practical skills, and problem-solving abilities to the professional world, whether it's in AI, machine vision, or full stack development. My journey is fueled by a desire to innovate and create impactful solutions, and I am excited to contribute my expertise to new challenges.</p>
