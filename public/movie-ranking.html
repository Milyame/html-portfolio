<h2>Top 3 Anime of the Season – Winter 2024 Ranking</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Mashle: Magic And Muscles</h3>
<p>Mashle: Magic and Muscles had a decent opening season, but it fell short of excellence. Blending Harry Potter and battle shonen tropes, the story is set in a world where nearly everyone can use magic; however, Mash Burnedead is an exception.</p>

<h3>Tsukimichi - Moonlit Fantasy</h3>
<p>Tsukimichi -Moonlit Fantasy- has all the ingredients synonymous with generic isekai anime: an overpowered protagonist, strong female characters who instantly decide they need a master, and a bog-standard medieval-style world</p>

<h3>Solo Leveling </h3>
<P>They say whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, but that’s not the case for the world’s weakest hunter Sung Jinwoo. After being brutally slaughtered by monsters in a high-ranking dungeon, 
Jinwoo came back with the System, a program only he could see, that’s leveling him up in every way. Now, he’s inspired to discover the secrets behind his powers and the dungeon that spawned them. </P>
